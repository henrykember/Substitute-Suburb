	    But a few years ago, I had to give my address for something, and for some reason that I've long since forgotten, I put a random bunch of words where my suburb should have been. And yet, the mail still arrived. 

	    This tells us a few things: 

	    If your suburb is experiencing gentrification and you no longer identify with it. If real estate agents have concocted their own term for your little corner of the world and you don't appreciate their choice of name. And if you just want to brand your piece of the rock, hell, they're all good reasons to do the following:

	  
	   Send us your mailing address including your substitute suburb name, and we'll send you a letter. If you get the letter, that suburb is yours to have. 
	    So far we've created new one-address suburbs in Sydney, Melbourne and Los Angeles. And we're really keen to see where else this'll work. 
	    There are 7 billion potential substitute suburbs out there. Claim yours.

		    Did you know that if you live in Sydney, you can call your suburb anything you want?
		    Yes.
		    Just get the street name and number and postcode right, and and go nuts with the suburb name.
		    Want proof?
		    Why not enter your address, along with whatever nutjob suburb name you come up with below, and I'll send you a letter.
		    If it works, try it on other stuff. Get the council to send rates letters.
