	    People define us by the suburb we live in.
	    Everything from socioeconomic status, to political leanings, and even what we wear or the car we drive; these are all assumptions made based on our postal address. But a few years ago, I had to give my address for something, and for some reason that I've long since forgotten, I put a random bunch of words where my suburb should have been. And yet, the mail still arrived. 
	    I then tested it further, with ever-more outlandish names (and numbers, and characters), and every time the mail turned up. What this tells us is, we can substitute anything we want for our suburb name. No more branding, no more assumptions - at least, none we don't want. 
	    It's pretty much up to you. 
	    So give us your mailing address including your substitute suburb name, and we'll send you a letter. If you get the letter, that suburb is yours to have.
	    So far we've created new one-address suburbs in Sydney, Melbourne and Los Angeles. And we're really keen to see where else this'll work. 
	    There are 7 billion potential substitute suburbs out there. Take yours.

		    Did you know that if you live in Sydney, you can call your suburb anything you want?
		    Yes.
		    Just get the street name and number and postcode right, and and go nuts with the suburb name.
		    Want proof?
		    Why not enter your address, along with whatever nutjob suburb name you come up with below, and I'll send you a letter.
		    If it works, try it on other stuff. Get the council to send rates letters.
